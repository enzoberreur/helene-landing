    "storyCard1p1": "\"One woman in my family was told by her doctor that she would face severe symptoms. She spent months anxious, bracing herself for the worst — letting that fear shape her days, her relationships, her sense of self.",
    "storyCard1p2": "In the end, she had barely any symptoms at all. The worry itself had become the burden.\"",
    "storyLabel2": "Total silence",
    "storyCard2p1": "\"The other didn't even know she was going through menopause. The mood changes, the disrupted sleep, the fog she couldn't shake — nobody told her any of it was connected.",
    "storyCard2p2": "She went through years of it completely alone, not understanding what was happening to her own body.\"",
    "storyResolution": "Two women. Two opposite failures of a system that should have been there for both of them.",
